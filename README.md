Mouf's no-cache service
=======================

This package contains an implementation of Mouf's CacheInterface that <strong>does not cache anything</strong>.
This can be useful if you want to disable caching mechanism in a service that requires cache.
To learn more about the cache interface, please see the [cache system documentation](http://mouf-php.com/packages/mouf/utils.cache.cache-interface).
